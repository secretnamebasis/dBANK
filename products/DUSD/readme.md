For fun I made a centrally backed stablecoin. 

It is called DUSD

I started the peg today and it is backed by $2250 of US mint. 

Here is a picture of the funds so far that back this stablecoin

Like USDC on DERO. If USDC goes CBDC, it would be pretty neat to see a community made stablecoin, imo.

So yesterday I started the process of committing capital to a community funded stablecoin. 

DUSD is simply US minted coin tokenized. Coinage is still one of the best forms of money, and if you are going to have a virtual token it might as well be a token of the real thing. 

The thought process was that users can deposit Minted Currency for to receive 1:1 DUSD Tokens. Because this is a grassroots stablecoin, withdrawals would be taxed to disincentivize bank run, like a 0.01% fee. Playing with the idea of a 1% fee on larger withdrawals. 

There wouldn't be leverage, the vault would maintain an accountable 1:1 direct relationship with the token.
